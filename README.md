1. Introduction 

1.1 Background 
When companies are looking to choose properties to invest in they sometimes look for what surrounds the property and the level of desirability of each surrounding venue.  According to ApartmentRatings.com and similar sites, when a person is looking for an apartment, he/she should take into consideration its proximity to “shopping and other services” as well as “family amenities”.   Stakeholders would be aware of this and may look at what surrounds a particular location before deciding to invest.

1.2 Interest 
This project assumes a client is deciding between two apartment complexes and would like to know more about the amenities close by to each. Special consideration is given to food venues as well as entertainment such as sports venues or artistic entertainment. Although this example is purely fictional, the process could be repeated for anyone who is looking to assess the location of different apartment complexes. 

2. Data

2.1 Data sources This data is mined from Foursquare, applying different sorts to organize the data and improve its usefulness.  Searches were made for “St Louis” and then narrowed down to the two apartment complexes.  Because Foursquare allows the developer to search for nearby venues, the results will be helpful in identifying what amenities are close to each apartment complex. Significant sorting and cleaning will need to be done as the “categories” column has much variety.  Food venues will be calculated together since this is a priority for the stakeholder.  Other considerations may occur as the project develops.
